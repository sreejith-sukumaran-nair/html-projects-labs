          <b>IPL 2024 KKR vs RR Highlights:</b> Jos Buttler almost
          single-handedly led Rajasthan Royals to a record-equalling chase of
          224 against the Kolkata Knight Riders with an unbeaten
          <i>107 off 60 balls</i>. Buttler battled cramps in the last over to
          knock off the winning runs and RR equalled the record for highest
          succesfull run chase in the IPL, which they themselves had set last
          year. The England captain started the last over with a six off the
          first ball, he then had to turn down runs off the next four balls,
          thus bringing the equation down to RR needing three runs to win off
          the last two balls. Buttler then hobbled two runs off the second last
          ball of the match and took a single off the last and thus took RR to a
          record-equalling chase.

            Badminton's former world No. 1 Momota Kento announced his
            international retirement on Thursday at a press conference in Tokyo
            (18 April).

        <p>
          Momota, 29, said his last tournament for the Japan national team will
          be the 27 April-5 May Thomas & Uber Cup Finals in Chengdu, People's
          Republic of China. The two-time world champion is ranked 52nd overall
          in the qualifying race for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games - seventh from
          Japan. Only the top two from a National Olympic Committee qualify for
          the Games. In 2019, Momota won a record 11 titles on the BWF Tour and
          was named the top men's player. But the following year in January, he
          was part of a fatal car crash in Kuala Lumpur that nearly killed him.
          Momota made his return to competition in December, but has not been
          the same since. The Kagawa Prefecture native failed to get out of the
          group at his home Games in Tokyo, and has just two tour wins since the
          career-altering accident.
