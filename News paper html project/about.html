          The Hindu, started in 1878 as a weekly, became a daily in 1889 and from then on has been steadily growing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Hindu's independent editorial stand and its reliable and balanced presentation of the news have over the years, won for it the serious attention and regard of the people who matter in India and abroad.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Hindu has a wide network of full-time and part-time correspondents and photographers across India. The Hindu is known for its strong reportage from the national capital as well as from the southern States and cities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Hindu has a major presence online: it was the first Indian newspaper to start an Internet edition, in 1995. The Hindu's digital versions, including the website, app, and e-paper, cater to an ever growing audience.
