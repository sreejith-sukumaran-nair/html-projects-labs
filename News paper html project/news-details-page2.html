        Japan's former world No. 1 Momota Kento to retire from international
        badminton
      </h2>
      <h4>
        The two-time world champion announces his last duty for the national
        team will be the 27 April-5 May Thomas & Uber Cup Finals in Chengdu,
        People's Republic of China.
      </h4>
      <p>
        Momota, 29, said his last tournament for the Japan national team will
        be the 27 April-5 May Thomas & Uber Cup Finals in Chengdu, People's
        Republic of China. The two-time world champion is ranked 52nd overall
        in the qualifying race for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games - seventh from
        Japan. Only the top two from a National Olympic Committee qualify for
        the Games. In 2019, Momota won a record 11 titles on the BWF Tour and
        was named the top men's player. But the following year in January, he
        was part of a fatal car crash in Kuala Lumpur that nearly killed him.
        Momota made his return to competition in December, but has not been
        the same since. The Kagawa Prefecture native failed to get out of the
        group at his home Games in Tokyo, and has just two tour wins since the
        career-altering accident.
